/*Design a class named Account that contains:
• A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
• A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0₹).
• A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current
interest rate (default 0%). Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
• A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the
account was created.
• A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
• A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
• The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate.
• The accessor method for dateCreated.
• A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
• A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
• A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
• A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
